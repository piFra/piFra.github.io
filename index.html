                    Yesterday while reading about <a href="http://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/pen-testing/2013/03/24/coinage-the-sans-pen-testing-coins-backstory">SANS coin backstory</a>
                    I thought about hacker wargames that are so popular right now. Since I'm passionate about Computer Security and hacking in general, I decided to give some wargame a try.
                    Where to start? Which game to choose? I searched a bit over the network, using the mystic oracle called GOOGLE. I found some nice answers, and 
                    and many of them said that the "Bandit" wargame from overthewire.org was a great starting point. So I said, why no? Let's try!
                    In this post I want to share my progress, my thoughts, my errors and offer some discussion points about the levels.
                    TL:DR; It' a really funny wargame! Congratulations overthewire! By the way it started from the basics and went trough some interesting concepts, like openSSL and SSH shells.
